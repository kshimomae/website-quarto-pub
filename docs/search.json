Understanding the factors influencing satisfaction can help airlines provide better services, retain customers, and improve their overall performance.\nCustomer satisfaction is a complex and multidimensional concept, shaped by numerous factors that can shift over time due to technological development, changes in customer preference and expectation, and a competitive market.\nThe decline in customer satisfaction can bring many negative impacts to the airline such as a negative reputation, lack of customer loyalty, loss of repeat purchases and businesses, and poor/negative online reviews affecting the company’s digital presence and performance.\nWith airlines facing increasing pressure to differentiate themselves in a competitive market, understanding key factors impacting customer satisfaction is more important than ever in order to make strategic and informed decisions about service improvement, operational efficiency, and appropriate training for employees."
