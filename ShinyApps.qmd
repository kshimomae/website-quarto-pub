# Answer: Building Interactive Web Apps with Shiny in R

# Introduction: What is Shiny?

-   Shiny is a package available to use in R Studio and originally developed by RStudio Inc. (current renamed company: Posit PBC) -ã€€Shiny enables users to make interactive web applications directly from R Studio & Python
-   Does not require users to have comprehensive knowledge of website development languages such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript
-   Can be used for data visualization, exploratory analysis, and interactive dashboards.

# Benefits of Using Shiny

-   Easy to use for users who are familiar with R and Python
-   Make the entire process of making interactive and responsive data-driven apps simple and easy
-   Effective and easy to share data analysis and insight from the data with any collaborator, including other users and your clients.

# Key Components of Shiny App

1.  **User Interface (UI)** defines the layout and appearance of the app.

-   Use functions like fluidPage(), sidebarLayout(), sidebarPanel(), mainPanel().
-   Has input elements (sliderInput(), selectInput())
-   Has output elements (plotOutput(), tableOutput()).

2.  **Server** includes the logic that constructs outputs based on user inputs.

-   Utilizes functions such as renderPlot(), renderTable(), and reactive({}) to make content in a dynamic way.

# Tips

-   Always start simple. Eventually, add more elements to make it complex
-   Use (reactive({})) reactive expressions in order to avoid redundant calculations
-   Include comments on each section/code clearly to make your App more organized and easy to understand
-   Learning new things, especially for coding, always has a learning curve. Try and error, and continue practicing
