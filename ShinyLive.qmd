# Answer: Shinylive


# Introduction: What is Shinylive? 
 
- Shinylive is an innovative approach to deploying Shiny applications and does not require a traditional R server. 
- Runs entirely within the web browser instead of using server-side computation
- Use of technology called WebAssembly 
- Enable easy deployment, sharing, and hosting of the shiny application
- Users can create interactive web apps that are fully on the client-side, allowing clients without any R background can easily use them. 

# Difference Between Traditional Shiny apps and Shinylive apps 

1. **Traditional Shiny Apps**
- Require an R server to do computations and generate outputs.
- Hosted on dedicated servers or cloud-based services, generally 
- Impact accessibility and scalability since it relies on the serverâ€™s availability and connectivity. 
 
2. **Shinylive Apps**
- No need for execution from the server side
- Run & generate entirely in the web browser 
- Utilize WebAssembly to execute code in R directly in the web environment 
- Easy to upload it on web hosts such as GitHub 


# Pros and Cons of Shinylive 

## Pros

- **Easy to Launch & Update**
  - Since Shinylive does not require a server, and makes hosting easy on web pages. Make the process simple and easy 
  
- **Cost Effective**
   - Does not require the need for infrastructure for the server, which contributes to cost reduction 
   
- **High Accessibility**
   - Apps are highly accessible, portable, and quickly laudable, and anyone can access them without relying on a server. 
   
- **Improved Scalability**
  - Many users can access the app at the same time without decreasing performance quality 


## Cons

- **Performance restriction **
  - Heavy and complex computation tasks might cause slow performance due to the limitations of the browser 
- **Limitations for data handling**
   - This is not suitable and ideal if users want to handle a large or complex dataset, since the large dataset needs to be downloaded to the browser. 

- **Restriction for functionality**
  - Some packages and certain functions still rely on the capability for server-side
